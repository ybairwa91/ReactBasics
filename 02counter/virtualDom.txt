//DOM=DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL==>it basically connects web pages to script(html,jsx,svg and much more),
dom basically hava document with logical tree,each branch of tree ends with a node and each node contains some objects.now dom allows to access the tree to the programming language.


//Browser Dom ==>when u change something it reload means whole DOM reload whenever new change occurs

//Now comes to the virtual dom created by React for its own convenience
whenever u change it only change the value and not the whole dom

//using DOM we update whenever user update them but what if dont update immediately and do the last updation only and leave the intermediate one

//now we have fiber in react which updates the new update or to say its behind the scene virtual dom which update behind the scene but new name is fiber

//its has more usuability in sphere of animation,layout,gestures since it update so fast and have a feature to skip the intermediate update and directly get back to final update as per user requests

..Incremental rendering is the headline feature of react fiber



##key feature 
        ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in;
         the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; 
         and new concurrency primitives.


//what is hydration===injecting js into the web programm or page is hydration means simply having a button and then using js to click on the button to render something is hydration Browser


//fibre is hard to understand but yeah we can understand



//reconciliation
   ////The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed. 
   Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM." 


//setState tells the update
//we dont care about behind the scene


//to improve lists we use key
